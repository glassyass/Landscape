  text1: "<p>Hello, I’m Donavon Wall, a Canadian from Prince Edward Island, now living in Alberta.</p>"
  title2: "My Bio"
  text2: "<p>Growing up, I spent countless hours in my grandmother’s garden, where I learned that farming and landscaping are about more than just crops and animals. She taught me that it’s about shaping the land with care and creating something beautiful. Those lessons stayed with me as I got older, and I spent several seasons working for various landscaping companies in Toronto, honing my skills and learning from the best in the business.
But no matter how far I went, something always called me back to my roots. I decided to bring that experience back home, to where it all began—close to the land and the people who mean the most to me. At Wildrose Landscape and Construction, I combine my passion for landscaping with a deep love for this place, creating beautiful outdoor spaces with the care and craftsmanship passed down through generations.</p>"
